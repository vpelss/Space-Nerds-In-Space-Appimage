I have created a Linux AppImage for Space Nerds In Space for those who can't compile it.

My AppImage version is here: https://github.com/vpelss/Space-Nerds-In-Space-Appimage/releases/tag/Newest

- Download
- open terminal at file path
- chmod +x Space_Nerds_in_Space-x86_64.AppImage
- ./Space_Nerds_in_Space-x86_64.AppImage

Tested succesfuly on:
