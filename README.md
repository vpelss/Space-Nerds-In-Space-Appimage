# Space-Nerds-In-Space-Appimage

I am attempting to create an AppImage for Space Nerds In Space so you don't have to build it to play this fine game.

My AppImage version is here: https://github.com/vpelss/Space-Nerds-In-Space-Appimage/releases/tag/Newest

Tested succesfuly on:
- q4OS
- mint cinnamon
- mint xfce
- MiniOS

Note: It must be started in a terminal!

1. Download.
2. chmod +x Space_Nerds_in_Space-x86_64.AppImage
3. ./Space_Nerds_in_Space-x86_64.AppImage

How it was built:

see instructions.txt
